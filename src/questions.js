  /*
  
  10 - Each number in the sequence increases by two. Starting from 2 and increasing by two each time, the next number after 8 is 10.
  
  3 - Since you take out 3 apples from the basket, you have 3 apples. The question asks how many apples you have, not how many are left in the basket.
  
  150 Miles - If a train travels at 60 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, it will cover 60 miles x 2.5 = 150 miles.
  
  180 Degrees - The sum of all angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.
  
  C - The sequence alternates forwards and backwards in the alphabet (A, Z, B, Y, C, X...), so the next letter is C.
  
  PQ - In the series, each pair of letters moves forward five positions in the alphabet (AB -> FG -> KL -> PQ).
  
  They become body parts when the first letters are removed - Removing the first letter of each word (DEAR -> EAR, SHIP -> HIP, SLIP -> LIP) results in body parts.
  
  i - Each letter is from a word that describes its ordinal position (f from fIRST, e from sECOND, i from thIRD, r from fouRTH, h from fIfTH).
  
  BE - Each letter pair comes from words describing the colors of medals in sports: FT (First - Gold), SD (Second - Silver), TD (Third - Bronze).
  
  Forty - Forty is the first number whose letters are in alphabetical order when spelled out.
  
  Animal - The letters "CIFAIPC" can be rearranged to form "PACIFIC," which is an animal, specifically referring to the Pacific Ocean, home to various animals.
  
  Future - The future is always ahead of you, but it can't be seen or observed directly.
  
  70 - Dividing 30 by half (which is 15) and then adding 10 results in 70 (30 รท 0.5 = 60; 60 + 10 = 70).
  
  Incorrectly - The word 'incorrectly' itself is spelled 'incorrectly'.
  
  Footsteps - The more footsteps you take, the more you leave behind.
  
  All of them - Every month in the calendar, including February, has at least 28 days.
  
  Piano - A piano has keys but cannot be used to open locks.
  
  Bottle - A bottle has a neck but no head.
  
  Stamp - A postage stamp can travel around the world while being stuck in a corner of an envelope.
  
  Fire - Fire grows when it burns, requires oxygen (air) to burn, but is extinguished by water.
